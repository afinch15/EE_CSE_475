As part of this embedded systems capstone project, I was responsible for designing and implementing key interactive features for our art installation/gaming platform:

Capacitive Touch Interface

Designed and soldered a custom capacitive touch grid using copper tape, mapping each connection to individual LEDs in a 12×16 matrix
Enabled precise touch detection across 192 individual touch points on the art canvas

Software Debouncing Algorithm

Implemented code-based debouncing to eliminate false positives from the capacitive touch sensors
Ensured that only one LED location could register input at a time, preventing erroneous multi-touch detections and improving user experience

Interactive "Simon Says" Game

Developed the Simon Says game logic in Python, interfacing with existing C functions on the STM32 microcontroller
Implemented real-time user input processing that captured touch inputs and updated the LED display to reflect game state changes
Created an engaging gameplay loop that transformed the art canvas into an interactive gaming platform

These contributions enabled the project to function both as a standalone interactive art piece and as a tabletop gaming platform, demonstrating skills in embedded systems programming, hardware-software integration, and user interface design.
